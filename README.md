# Bond Yield Price Calculator
A simple bond yield and bond price calculator.
Using a barebones cli, the user can enter information about their bond and determine its either one of two things.

# Bond Yield Rate
This finds the yield to maturity rate which is the total anticipated return on a bond if the bond is held until it matures. This is found using a binary search algorithm for efficiency.

# Bond Price
This finds the price that a bond should trade at based upon the par value of the bond and current yields availible in the market.

# Notes
This calculator is assuming a coupon payment frequency of once a year! It does not currently accomodate for monthly, quarterly, or biannual frequencies.

The variable names might also seem a bit odd but that's because I was learning about bonds when this project was made. The math is pretty simple but with no financial background the terminology was a little confusing.
